ES6 Features
why arrow? => Arrow functions do not have their own this. Instead, they inherit this from the surrounding (lexical) scope.
template Literals => `my name is  ${saitama}`
Destructuring => const { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 30 };
Spread: Expand iterable elements.
Rest: Collect arguments into an array.
Promises => Handle asynchronous operations more gracefully than callbacks.
promise.all => this helps to make multiple api call but anyone get failed all will failed.
Enhanced Object Literals : 
let x = 10;
let obj = {
  x,
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};
For...of Loop =>Loop over iterable objects (arrays, strings, etc.)
